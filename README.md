# Event Booking Platform ðŸŽ«

A simple web-based Event Booking Platform built with **Spring Boot (Java)** and a lightweight HTML + Bootstrap frontend.

This app allows users to:
- Create and view events
- Book events by entering their name
- View total bookings and who booked each event

Everything runs locally â€” just start the Spring Boot application and open `index.html` in the browser.

ðŸš€ Perfect for learning Spring Boot CRUD, REST APIs, and frontend integration without any frameworks.
